      <description>The plugin helps database administrators who use PostgreSQL and Salesforce IDS in their database to have a more efficient internal representation that helps reduce space and time to compute comparison between two ids as opposed to using a text type.

      <description>I founded Nuodata.io: a SaaS platform and open source open source project. It is based on PostgreSQL and Node.js. I am responsible for the development and the architecture of the project.
  nuodata-db-api  nuodata-server http://nuodata.io  The goal is to use tables and views as your API endpoints, for CRUD operations. The goal is to shift a lot of development to the database to save time and have a more reliable data and system.</description>

      <description>The Semantic Web is a set of technologies that aims to make data available and easily readable for machine via the web. Unlike the classic Web where resources are pages published using natural language and some structured information, resources in the Semantic Web are organized formally using a set of languages developed by the W3C. Search engines are crucial for discovering those resources. Sindice is a semantic web search engine that crawls the Web looking for those kind of information.</description>

      <description>The objective of the project was to develop an implementation of the SAFER backpack propulsion system using formal methods. SAFER backpack was designed by NASA. It helps an astronaut, in case of accidental separation from the spacecraft during an EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity), to return to his space shuttle.
This project goal was to develop a working software system for the backpack, from the NASA specification document and using the B-method.</description>
